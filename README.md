# Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a **Housing Price Prediction** model using linear regression to estimate housing prices based on features like location, size, and number of rooms.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and converts categorical variables to numeric using one-hot encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes relationships between features and housing prices.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes Linear Regression and evaluates performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-price-prediction.git
